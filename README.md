# Advanced Skin Disease Diagnosis: Leveraging Image Processing

## ðŸ“œ Introduction

Skin diseases are among the leading reasons for medical consultations, where accurate and timely diagnosis plays a critical role in determining appropriate treatment. This project introduces an innovative solution leveraging advanced deep learning and image processing to diagnose skin diseases.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Skin Disease Detection**: Upload an image of a skin condition to receive an accurate diagnosis with the disease name and details.
- **Treatment Insights**: Provides key information to assist healthcare professionals and users in making informed decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive interface for ease of use.

## ðŸ§  Model

We utilized **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for robust image classification, trained on a dataset of skin disease images to achieve high accuracy and reliable results.

### Key Highlights:
- The model identifies common skin conditions like cellulitis, impetigo, ringworm, athlete's foot, and more.
- It has been fine-tuned on pre-trained data to maximize its diagnostic performance.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset comprises images of various skin diseases, including but not limited to cellulitis, nail fungus, athlete's foot, cutaneous larva migrans, chickenpox, and shingles.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS 
- **Backend**: Django
- **Deep Learning**: Vision Transformer (ViT)
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Upload an image of the skin condition.
2. The system processes the image using **OpenCV** for pre-processing.
3. The pre-processed image is analyzed by the **Vision Transformer model**.
4. The detected disease name and diagnostic insights are displayed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements

- Add more disease categories to the dataset for broader coverage.
- Implement real-time diagnosis using a mobile app interface.
- Integrate multilingual support for a global user base.
